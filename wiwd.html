          <p>
            My name is Percival, Percy for short. <br />
            Im a 49 year old web developer and UI designer based in the
            Vancouver BC area. I'm a father of two kids. Brooklyn is 7 years old
            and is loving second grade. Our newest editon to the family id
            Zachary. He is 6 months young and is a very happy little boy who
            loves to eat his vegetables in mushy form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Im a recent graduate of the Red Academy. I studied the Web Developer
            as well as the UX/UI programs there. 
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            As a UI designer, I am competent with color theory, composition/space, design thinking/research, branding systems, logo design, client relations and public speaking to name a few. <br>
            I made a choice to learn UI design and sought to become a well rounded technologist. Armed with coding skills, I feel I'm a valuable asset to any organization as I can not only design web/app elements, but I can also code them and bring them to life. <br> While working in either roll I bridge the communication/relationship gap within the teams.
        </p>
            My passion lies as a coder.
            I love to write code that has awesome functionality and to make apps
            that enrich peoples lives.
            I love to design, but I think coding gives me the greatest satisfaction.
