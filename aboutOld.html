          <p>
            Most people call me Percy, I get called Percival when I'm in trouble. <br />
            Im a 49 year old Front End Web Developer and UI designer based in the
            Vancouver BC area. I'm a father of two beautiful children. Brooklyn is 7 years old
            and is loving second grade. Our newest edition to the family is
            Zachary. He's 6 months young and is a very happy little boy who loves his mushy peas. <br>
            I'm a veteran of 27yrs from a place called COSTCO. You may have heard of it. <br>  I had the opportunity to make the leap into the tech field and I decided to study Web Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Im a recent graduate of Red Academy. I studied the Web Developer professional
            as well as the UI communication programs there. 
            <br />
         </p>
        <p>
            As a UI designer, I am competent with color theory, composition/space, design thinking/research, branding systems, logo design, client relations and public speaking to name a few. <br>
            I made a choice to learn UI design and sought to become a well rounded technologist. Armed with coding skills, I feel I'm a valuable asset to any organization as I can not only design web/app elements, but I can also code them and bring them to life. <br> While working in either roll I bridge the communication/relationship gap between the teams. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies as a coder.
            I love to write code that has awesome functionality and to make apps
            that enrich peoples lives.
            I love to design, but I think coding gives me the greatest satisfaction. Currently I'm studying React js. I'm finding that its a smooth transition, as the react library and syntax are familiar to what I currently know. Also, working in teams using the Agile software development process was eye opening to me. It has really opened my eyes into a whole new world of creating new projects. Im currently looking for employment, but I'm excited about growing with a company that's going to nurture my thirst for knowledge and help me become the best developer that I can be. <br><br>   Skies the limit! <br><br>  Wish me luck on a new adventure ! <br><br> Percy.
